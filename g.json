Their tribe is very exceptional. Nigeria is in West Africa. The Igbo tribe is located in the south-eastern part of Nigeria, and Igbo is the official language being spoken. The Igbo people have a rich cultural heritage and a strong sense of identity, with a history that dates back centuries. Their language, Igbo, is a member of the Niger-Congo language family and is spoken by millions of people around the world. The Igbo tribe is known for their entrepreneurial spirit, artistic expression, and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>\n\nImage: Eserese Maapu Igbo\nImage: Surrounding states of the Igbo land\n\n<p>Over the years, there have been some controversial discussions about the origin of the Igbo people. It is of importance and significance that the Igbo people are found inhabiting other tribe lands. Despite their significant contributions to Nigerian society, the Igbo people have faced marginalization and discrimination, particularly in the political and economic spheres. The Nigerian civil war, also known as the Biafran War, had a devastating impact on the Igbo people and their land, leading to widespread displacement, poverty, and suffering.</p>\n\n<h2>Features of an Igbo person:</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Food - Nni</li>\n    <li>Dressing - Akwa</li>\n    <li>Festival - Iri ji</li>\n    <li>Name - Afa</li>\n    <li>Language - Asusu</li>\n    <li>Greeting - Ekele</li>\n    <li>Physical features - Ajala</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The language of Igbo People:</h2>\n<p>Language is a system of communication consisting of a set of rules, conventions, and symbols used to convey meaning and express thoughts, ideas, and experiences.

Find the work done.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>F = m x g = 70 x 10 = 700N</li>\n    <li>h = 4m</li>\n    <li>W = 700 x 4 = 2800 Nm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<p>A loaded sack of total mass 55 kg falls down from the floor of the lorry 3.9 m, calculate the work done.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n<p>W = 1.93 Nm</p>\n\n<h3>Exercise:</h3>\n<p>A boy is pulled 20 m above a horizontal plane with a constant force of n Newton.</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Parallel to the plane</li>\n    <li>In the direction of angle 60 degrees to the horizontal, calculate the work done.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Energy</h2>\n<p>Energy is defined as the capacity to do work.</p>\n\n<h3>Classifications of Mechanical Energy</h3>\n<p>Mechanical Energy simply means the energy stored or energy possessed by a virtue of its position or state. The figure below shows a body of mass when the height of h above the suspended. The potential energy possessed by the body is given by:</p>\n<p><strong>P.E: F x h</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the weight of the body is equal to the gravitational force, F is equal to mg, therefore:</p>\n<p><strong>P.E = mgh</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<p>Find the potential energy of a boy of mass 10 kg standing on a building floor 15 m above the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n<p>PE = 10 x 10 x 15 = 1500 J</p>\n\n<h3>Kinetic Energy:</h3>\n<p>Kinetic energy of a moving body is defined as the ability to do work by the virtue of its motion. If the mass of the body is m, and the body moves with a constant speed v, the kinetic energy is given by:</p>\n<p><strong>KE = 1/2 mv²</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<p>An object of mass 15 kg is moving with a constant velocity of 15 m/s. Calculate its kinetic energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n<p>KE = 1/2 x 15 x 15² = 112.5 J</p>\n\n<h2>Power</h2>\n<p>Power is work done in a given time. It’s the time-rate of doing work. It’s given by:</p>\n<p><strong>P = Work Done (Energy Expended) / Time</strong></p>\n<p>If work is in Joules and time is in seconds, then the power is measured in J/s (Watts).</p>\n\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<p>A car is moving at 20 m/s. The force retarding its motion is 500 N. Calculate the engine power of the car required to maintain motion.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>\n<p>First, calculate the frictional force (F) opposing the motion, which is equal to the force retarding its motion (500 N).</p>\n<p>Next, we need to calculate the velocity (v) of the car, which is given as 20 m/s.</p>\n<p>We can then calculate the power (P) required to maintain motion using the formula:</p>\n<p><strong>P = F × v</strong></p>\n<p>Substituting the values, we get:</p>\n<p>P = 500 N × 20 m/s = 10,000 W</p>\n\n<h2>Transformation & Conservation of Energy:</h2>\n<p>A foregoing discussion has turned that work, potential energy & kinetic energy are all related by a means of simple energy which can be changed from one form to another.</p>\n\n<p>Energy transformation is the process of changing energy from one form to another. This process involves a conversion of energy from one type to another, but the total energy remains constant.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when you turn on a light bulb, electrical energy is converted into light and heat. The energy hasnt been created; its been transformed from one form (electrical) to another (light and heat).</p>\n\n<p>Energy transformation is an essential concept in physics and is crucial for understanding how energy is harnessed and utilized in various natural and man-made phenomena.</p>\n\n", "timestamp": "09:41:11", "datestamp": "2024-06-26", "lecturer": "Nil", "is_premium": "Yes", "textbook": "Physics Textbook", "manual": "Physics Manual"}, "23": {"id": "23", "name": "GST111 - Literature", "content": "However literature is mostly used to refer to creative writing. In this sense, literature can be defined as an imaginative work of art used to recreate human experiences.\n\nFunctions\n • Literature entertains\n • Literature teaches human experiences\n • Literature teaches culture \n • Literature is a tool for language learning\n • Literature is a language for studying \n\nGenres of Literature\nThere are three genres of literature:\n 1. Drama: It deals with play. A play is written to be acted on stage where it is meant to be watched by the audience. Therefore action is central to play. Plays are segmented in acts and scenes or in episodes. One who writes play is known as a playwright.\n 2. Poetry: Poetry deals with poets. Poems are made to be read aloud because they rely on sound devices. Poems are segmented in stanzas. One who writes poem is known as a poets.\n 3. Prose: it’s concerned with narratives. It can be fiction or not fiction. Examples of fiction include novel, novelette/novella, short stories. Examples of non fiction include biography, auto-biography, diary.\nElements of literature:\n 1. Subject\n 2. Theme\n 3. Settings\n 4. Plot\n 5. Character & Characterization\n 6. Point of view\n 7. Diction\n\nSubject means the surface story that the reader reads or what the story is taking about?\n\nTheme refers to the message of the story. It is a lesson that the reader derived from the story \n\nSettings refers to the locale or environment of the story. Every story is located in place and time.", "timestamp": "12:45:11", "datestamp": "2024-06-26", "lecturer": "Nil", "is_premium": "No", "textbook": "Communication in English", "manual": "Communication in English Manual"}}
